 * \class Q3DScatter
 * \inmodule QtDataVisualization
 * \brief The Q3DScatter class provides methods for rendering 3D scatter graphs.
 * \since QtDataVisualization 1.0
 *
 * This class enables developers to render scatter graphs in 3D and to view them by rotating the scene
 * freely. Rotation is done by holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse. Zooming
 * is done by mouse wheel. Selection, if enabled, is done by left mouse button. The scene can be
 * reset to default camera view by clicking mouse wheel. In touch devices rotation is done
 * by tap-and-move, selection by tap-and-hold and zoom by pinch.
 *
 * If no axes are set explicitly to Q3DScatter, temporary default axes with no labels are created.
 * These default axes can be modified via axis accessors, but as soon any axis is set explicitly
 * for the orientation, the default axis for that orientation is destroyed.
 *
 * Q3DScatter supports more than one series visible at the same time.
 *
 * \section1 How to construct a minimal Q3DScatter graph
 *
 * First, construct Q3DScatter. Since we are running the graph as top level window
 * in this example, we need to clear the \c Qt::FramelessWindowHint flag, which gets set by
 * default:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 0
 *
 * Now Q3DScatter is ready to receive data to be rendered. Add one series of 3 QVector3D items:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 1
 *
 * Finally you will need to set it visible:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 2
 *
 * The complete code needed to create and display this graph is:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dscatter_construction.cpp 3
 *
 * And this is what those few lines of code produce:
 *
 * \image q3dscatter-minimal.png
 *
 * The scene can be rotated, zoomed into, and an item can be selected to view its position,
 * but no other interaction is included in this minimal code example.
 * You can learn more by familiarizing yourself with the examples provided, like
 * the \l{Scatter Example}.
