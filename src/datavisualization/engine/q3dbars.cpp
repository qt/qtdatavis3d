 * \class Q3DBars
 * \inmodule QtDataVisualization
 * \brief The Q3DBars class provides methods for rendering 3D bar graphs.
 * \since QtDataVisualization 1.0
 *
 * This class enables developers to render bar graphs in 3D and to view them by rotating the scene
 * freely. Rotation is done by holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse. Zooming
 * is done by mouse wheel. Selection, if enabled, is done by left mouse button. The scene can be
 * reset to default camera view by clicking mouse wheel. In touch devices rotation is done
 * by tap-and-move, selection by tap-and-hold and zoom by pinch.
 *
 * If no axes are set explicitly to Q3DBars, temporary default axes with no labels are created.
 * These default axes can be modified via axis accessors, but as soon any axis is set explicitly
 * for the orientation, the default axis for that orientation is destroyed.
 *
 * Q3DBars supports more than one series visible at the same time. It is not necessary for all series
 * to have the same amount of rows and columns.
 * Row and column labels are taken from the first added series, unless explicitly defined to
 * row and column axes.
 *
 * \section1 How to construct a minimal Q3DBars graph
 *
 * First, construct an instance of Q3DBars. Since we are running the graph as top level window
 * in this example, we need to clear the \c Qt::FramelessWindowHint flag, which gets set by
 * default:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dbars_construction.cpp 4
 *
 * After constructing Q3DBars, you can set the data window by changing the range on the row and
 * column axes. It is not mandatory, as data window will default to showing all of the data in
 * the series. If the amount of data is large, it is usually preferable to show just a
 * portion of it. For the example, let's set the data window to show first five rows and columns:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dbars_construction.cpp 0
 *
 * Now Q3DBars is ready to receive data to be rendered. Create a series with one row of 5 values:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dbars_construction.cpp 1
 *
 * \note We set the data window to 5 x 5, but we are adding only one row of data. This is ok,
 * the rest of the rows will just be blank.
 *
 * Finally you will need to set it visible:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dbars_construction.cpp 2
 *
 * The complete code needed to create and display this graph is:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dbars_construction.cpp 3
 *
 * And this is what those few lines of code produce:
 *
 * \image q3dbars-minimal.png
 *
 * The scene can be rotated, zoomed into, and a bar can be selected to view its value,
 * but no other interaction is included in this minimal code example. You can learn more by
 * familiarizing yourself with the examples provided, like the \l{Bars Example}.
