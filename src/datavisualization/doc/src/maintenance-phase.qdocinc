\note The Qt Data Visualization module is in the maintenance phase. For new
projects, consider using the \l {Qt Graphs} module. For 3D rendering, QtGraphs
uses QtQuick3D, which in turn uses QtRhi. QtRhi relies on each platform's native
rendering backend (Metal on macOS, DirectX on Windows, OpenGL or Vulkan on
Linux). To migrate from Qt Data Visualization to Qt Graphs module, refer to
\l {Qt Graphs Migration from Qt DataVisualization}.
